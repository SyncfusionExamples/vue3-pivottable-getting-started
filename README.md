The sample demonstrates how to integrate the Syncfusion Pivot Table component into a Vue 3 application using the Vue CLI. The following features are shown in this sample.

1. Binding JSON data source.
2. Defining fields from the bound data source to row, column, value and filter areas to render the entire Pivot Table component in a desired format.
3. Adding height and width to the pivot table component.
4. Enabling field list to add or remove and re-arrange the fields between different areas, including column, row, value, and filter along with filter and sort options dynamically at runtime.
5. Enabling grouping bar that automatically populates fields from the bound data source and allows to drag fields between different areas such as columns, rows, values, and filters, and alter pivot table at runtime.
6. Enabling calculated field to add a new calculated field based on the available fields from the bound data source using basic arithmetic operators at runtime.
